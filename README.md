**This project is a part of my The Odin Project course.**
I've learnt about basics of HTML, such as headings, paragraphs, images, anchors...
Here, in this project, I put that into practice, by creating a Recipes website.
This was also my first time using Git (inside a CLI) to manage and save my project.
